- `storage_name` (string) - The name of the storage that will be used to find the first matching storage in the list of existing templates.
  
  Note that `storage_uuid` parameter has higher priority. You should use either `storage_uuid` or `storage_name` for not strict matching (e.g "ubuntu server 20.04").

- `template_prefix` (string) - The prefix to use for the generated template title. Defaults to `custom-image`.
  You can use this option to easily differentiate between different templates.

- `template_name` (string) - Similarly to `template_prefix`, but this will allow you to set the full template name and not just the prefix.
  Defaults to an empty string, meaning the name will be the storage title.
  You can use this option to easily differentiate between different templates.
  It cannot be used in conjunction with the prefix setting.

- `storage_size` (int) - The storage size in gigabytes. Defaults to `25`.
  Changing this value is useful if you aim to build a template for larger server configurations where the preconfigured server disk is larger than 25 GB.
  The operating system disk can also be later extended if needed. Note that Windows templates require large storage size, than default 25 Gb.

- `state_timeout_duration` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait for resource state changes. Defaults to `5m`.

- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait after booting the server. Defaults to '0s'

- `clone_zones` ([]string) - The array of extra zones (locations) where created templates should be cloned.
  Note that default `state_timeout_duration` is not enough for cloning, better to increase a value depending on storage size.

- `network_interfaces` ([]NetworkInterface) - The array of network interfaces to request during the creation of the server for building the packer image.

- `ssh_private_key_path` (string) - Path to SSH Private Key that will be used for provisioning and stored in the template.

- `ssh_public_key_path` (string) - Path to SSH Public Key that will be used for provisioning.
