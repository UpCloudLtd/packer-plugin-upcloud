- `username` (string) - The username to use when interfacing with the UpCloud API.

- `password` (string) - The password to use when interfacing with the UpCloud API.

- `zone` (string) - The zone in which the server and template should be created (e.g. nl-ams1).

- `storage_uuid` (string) - The UUID of the storage you want to use as a template when creating the server.

- `storage_name` (string) - The name of the storage that will be used to find the first matching storage in the list of existing templates.
  
  Note that `storage_uuid` parameter has higher priority. You should use either `storage_uuid` or `storage_name` for not strict matching (e.g "ubuntu server 20.04").
